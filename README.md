# face-dataset-facerecognition
In this project when you will run the python script then it will automatic save the your face image( morethan fifty) using webcam. 
Using harcascade file detect the face and crop the face part using python script.
I have already created a previous repo for face_dataset. In this repo we will press the k buttom the take a pic of face using webcam.
But in this repo automatic capture a pic face part and store the subfolder you have given in script.
